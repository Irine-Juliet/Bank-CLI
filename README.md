# Bank-CLI
CPSC 327: Object Oriented Programming. A simple Bank application with a command line interface (CLI). This application allows you to open accounts of different types, add transactions to accounts, view balances, and load/save in a file. I am currently working on enhancing the functionality to include a Graphical User Interphase.
